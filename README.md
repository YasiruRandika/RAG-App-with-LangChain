# 🧠 RAG-with-LangChain

Welcome to my first hands-on exploration of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/). This repository is a personal learning space where I experiment with building intelligent, context-aware applications that combine LLMs with external data sources.

---

## 📚 Purpose

This repo is created for **educational and experimental purposes**. I'm using it to:
- Understand the core components of LangChain's RAG pipeline.
- Test document loaders, vector stores, retrievers, and chains.
- Explore how RAG can enhance LLM responses with real-time or domain-specific data.

## 🛠️ What’s Inside

- `main.py`: Initial script to wire up a basic RAG flow.
- `docs/`: Sample documents used for retrieval.
- `config/`: Environment and model configuration files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter experiments and visual debugging.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies for running the project.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YasiruRandika/RAG-App-with-LangChain.git
cd RAG-App-with-LangChain
pip install -r requirements.txt
